# Force Actions module

The purpose of this module is to force an action to be applied if particular symbols are found/not found and optionally return a specified SMTP message. It is available in version 1.5.0 and greater.

## Configuration

Configuration should be added to `/etc/rspamd/local.d/force_actions.conf`

The following elements are valid in the rules of this module:

 - `action`: action to force if the rule matches
 - `expression`: a symbol or combination of symbols to match on
 - `honor_action`: actions in this list should not be overridden
 - `message`: SMTP message to be used by MTA
 - `require_action`: override action only if metric action in this list
 - `subject`: subject to set in metric for `rewrite subject` action
 - `limit`: minimum expression score required to trigger the action (default: 0)
 - `least`: if true, use the least significant action when multiple rules match
 - `process_all`: if true, continue processing other rules even after a match
 - `priority`: passthrough priority used to arbitrate between multiple matching rules (default: `normal`); accepts `low`, `normal`, `high`, `critical`, or the equivalent numeric values `0`-`3`

Only one of `honor_action` or `require_action` should be set on a given rule.

[Composite expressions](/configuration/composites#composite-expressions) can be used for `expression`.

[Selectors](/configuration/selectors) can be used to generate dynamic `message`. The selector expression must be enclosed in `${}`.

### Symbol names

Each rule named `MY_RULE` produces a registered symbol called `FORCE_ACTION_MY_RULE` (the rule name is uppercased). These symbol names can be used when setting up dependencies or checking debug output.

### Execution Order

If neither `require_action` nor `honor_action` is specified and `expression` does not reference a [composite](/configuration/composites#composite-expressions), the respective force action symbol is registered as a normal filter with a dependency on all symbols referenced in `expression`.
If at least one of `require_action` or `honor_action` is specified, or `expression` references a composite, the respective force action symbol is registered as a post filter.
For example, this is important if you want to revert an action that is decided upon the total score, as the action is only updated once all normal filters are completed.

Composites are only resolved after normal filters have run, so a rule cannot depend on one directly; it is auto-promoted to a postfilter instead. A rule promoted this way is still skipped if an earlier rule already set a pre-result without `process_all`, since that stops composite evaluation entirely — set `process_all = true` on whichever rule fires first in that case.

### Priority

When more than one rule matches for the same message, `priority` decides which one wins: the highest-priority match is applied regardless of registration order. Available priorities, from lowest to highest, are `low` (`0`), `normal` (`1`), `high` (`2`) and `critical` (`3`). Rules without an explicit `priority` default to `normal`.

An invalid `priority` (not one of the named values or a number, a fractional value, a value outside `0`-`3`, or `NaN`) is logged as a warning and the rule falls back to the default priority. Setting `priority` together with `least` also logs a warning, since a `least` rule can never outrank a non-`least` result — `priority` then only affects ordering among other `least` rules.

When a rule with an explicit `priority` fires, its `FORCE_ACTION_*` symbol carries a `priority:N` option (alongside the forced action name) so the value is visible in the scan output rather than only in the passthrough result.

### Legacy configuration

Older configurations used a flat `actions {}` block with action names as keys mapping to lists of expressions, and an optional `messages {}` block mapping expressions to SMTP messages:

~~~hcl
# Legacy format — avoid for new deployments
actions {
  reject = ["SYMBOL_A", "SYMBOL_B"];
}
messages {
  SYMBOL_A = "Rejected by policy";
}
~~~

When Rspamd detects this layout (`opts.actions` present) it logs "Processing legacy config" and registers symbols automatically. Symbol names in legacy mode are derived from a hash of the expression (`FORCE_ACTION_` followed by 12 hex characters) rather than a human-readable rule name. Migrate to the `rules {}` format to get stable, human-readable symbol names.

### Examples

~~~hcl
# Rules are defined in the rules {} block
rules {

  # For each condition we want to force an action on we define a rule

  # Rule is given a descriptive name
  MY_WHITELIST {
    # This is the action we want to force
    action = "no action";
    # If the following combination of symbols is present:
    expression = "IS_IN_WHITELIST & !CLAM_VIRUS & !FPROT_VIRUS";
  }

  WHITELIST_EXCEPTION {
    action = "reject";
    expression = "IS_IN_WHITELIST & (CLAM_VIRUS | FPROT_VIRUS)";
    # message setting sets SMTP message returned by mailer
    message = "Rejected due to suspicion of virus";
  }

  REJECT_MIME_BAD { 
    action = "reject";
    expression = "MIME_BAD";
    # message can contain selector expressions enclosed in ${}
    message = "(support-id: ${queueid}) Your mail was rejected because it contains BANNED ATTACHMENTS. Please check https://www.example.com/${languages.first}/allowed-attachments.html for further details!"
  } 

  DCC_BULK {
    action = "rewrite subject";
    # Here expression is just one symbol
    expression = "DCC_BULK";
    # subject setting sets metric subject for rewrite subject action
    subject = "[BULK] %s";
    # honor_action setting define actions we don't want to override
    honor_action = ["reject", "soft reject", "add header"];
  }

  BAYES_SPAM_UPGRADE {
    action = "add header";
    expression = "BAYES_SPAM";
    # require_action setting defines actions that will be overridden
    require_action = ["no action", "greylist"];
  }

}
~~~
